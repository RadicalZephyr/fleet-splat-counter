Pseudocode

Get Data
(
Read attack event log (all pages)
create list of all events
weed list of non-splats
) -> list of event objects for all splats in event log 'splatlog'

Process Data

splatlog -> splattee count
(
get defender player id from all events
don't make duplicate entries for players splatted multiple times
) -> list of all splattee's with id's 'splatteelist'

splatlog -> splatterer count
(
get fleetplayer id from all events
don't duplicate entries for players who splat multiple times
) -> list of all splatter's with id's 'splatterlist'

splatlog -> tally X
(
for each event add to player's tally on appropriate list
) -> fully tallied splattelist and splatterlist

Data Structures

splatterList
- ordered list of all splatter's
- indexes on all UID's of above that contain another list
sublist
- same structure as exterior list, but for splattee's that have been
   splatted by the splatter, and the indexed list has the total

splatteeList
- orderedlist of all splattee's
- index of UID's of above contain total # of splats on them
